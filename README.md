Analysis of Car Speed and Stopping Distance

For my analysis, I will be using the "Cars" dataset, which is available as a built-in dataset in R. This dataset provides information about the speed and stopping distance of various cars, which is relevant to mechanical engineering.

Here's what you need to know about the variables in this dataset:

- X (Predictor Variable): Speed (mph) - This indicates the speed of the car when its brakes are applied.
- Y (Response Variable): Stopping Distance (ft) - This represents the distance it takes for the car to come to a complete stop after its brakes have been applied.

The sample size for this dataset is 50 observations. The data has been sourced from the standard set of measurements for car performance.
